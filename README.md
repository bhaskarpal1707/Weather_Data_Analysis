# 🌤️ **Weather Data Analysis Using Kaggle Dataset**

## 📊 **Project Overview**
This project involves a detailed **weather data analysis** using a Kaggle dataset. The goal is to explore patterns and correlations among various meteorological factors, including:
- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Wind Speed**
- **Cloud Cover**
- **Air Quality**
- **Sunrise and Sunset Times**

## 🔎 **Key Insights**

### ✅ **1. Temperature vs. Feels-like Temperature**
- A **strong linear correlation** exists between temperature and the perceived "feels-like" temperature.
- The difference becomes significant at higher temperatures (>30°C) due to humidity effects.

### ✅ **2. Humidity and Cloud Cover Relationship**
- A **positive correlation** was observed between humidity and cloud cover.
- Higher humidity (>60%) typically leads to denser cloud formation.

### ✅ **3. Wind Speed and Direction Patterns**
- Predominant wind directions:  
  - **West (W)**  
  - **Northwest (NW)**  
  - **West-Northwest (WNW)**  
- Wind speeds generally remain below **20 km/h**, with occasional bursts from the **South-Southwest (SSW)** direction.

### ✅ **4. Air Quality Index (AQI) Variations**
- Most locations exhibit **good to moderate air quality** (AQI < 4).  
- Occasional spikes above **6** indicate poor air quality in certain regions.

### ✅ **5. Sunrise and Sunset Trends**
- A **linear relationship** between sunrise and sunset times.  
- Sunrise times range from **4:45 AM to 6:00 AM**, while sunset occurs between **5:30 PM and 7:00 PM**.
